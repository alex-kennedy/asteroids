# The Solar System

This little hobby project is designed as a visualisation of some of the orbital 
data we have about our solar system. Most interestingly, the eight planets (plus
Pluto, if that's your thing), the five known Dwarf Planets and the
700,000 plus (!) asteroids we know about. 

I made it because this knowledge is beautiful and extraordinary, isn't it? 

I have made every effort to get the Physics right, however, I am but a Physicist
in training. If you spot any errors, please make them known to me. I will thank
you with a warm message <3. 


## Data Sources

This project makes heavy (and very grateful) use of some wonderful open data 
sources:

 - Asteroid data is drawn from the [International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/data)
 - The star positions and brightnesses are from Version 5 of the [Yale Bright Star Catalog](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html)
 - Orbits of the planets (and Pluto) are from [JPL Solar System Dynamics](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planet_phys_par)
